## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-diary-app.git
    cd personal-diary-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Supabase Setup

1. **Create a new project on Supabase**:
   - Go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io/) and create a new project.
   - Note down your `Project URL` and `anon` key from the API settings.

2. **Create the diary entries table**:
   - In the Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL editor and run the following SQL command:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS diary_entries (
        id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        entry_date date NOT NULL,
        entry_time time NOT NULL,
        category varchar(50) NOT NULL,
        content text NOT NULL,
        image_url varchar(255),
        created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
        CHECK (entry_date <= current_date)
    );
    ```

3. **Insert sample data (optional)**:
   - Run the following SQL command in the Supabase SQL editor to add some sample diary entries:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO diary_entries (entry_date, entry_time, category, content, image_url) VALUES 
        ('2024-08-01', '09:00:00', 'Personal', 'Started a new diary today. Feeling excited!', 'https://example.com/images/diary_entry1.jpg'), 
        ('2024-08-02', '10:30:00', 'Work', 'Had a productive meeting with the team.', 'https://example.com/images/diary_entry2.jpg'),
        ('2024-08-03', '12:15:00', 'Travel', 'Visited the beach and enjoyed a beautiful sunset.', 'https://example.com/images/diary_entry3.jpg');
    ```

4. **Configure the Supabase client in your project**:
   - In your project, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:

    ```bash
    SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
    ```

   - Update your project to use the Supabase client. For example, you might have a `supabaseClient.js` file:

    ```javascript
    const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');

    const supabaseUrl = process.env.SUPABASE_URL;
    const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

    const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);

    module.exports = supabase;
    ```
